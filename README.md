# WeatherPrediction
 Weather Prediction algorithm that predicts weather in CC, TX. It uses NCEI's database.

Ridge regression model is used for predictions.  
The average error rate is currently 3.7 degreed F  
You can see how I managed to bring the error number down by using the ML techniques that I learned while working on this project  
This project is completed entirely based on my personal interest in ML field  
You can just request data from NCEI for your city and use it.  
By completing the step above you will probably reach lower error number depending on suffistication level of the data provided by your nearest airport.
